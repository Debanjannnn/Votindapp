# 🗳️ VoteChori - Decentralized Voting System

VoteChori is a **beginner-friendly decentralized voting system** built using **Solidity** and deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
It allows anyone to participate in transparent, tamper-proof voting where each user can vote only once per proposal.  
Built for learning, this project showcases how blockchain can bring **fairness and trust** to digital decision-making.

---

## 🌍 Project Description

**VoteChori** is a smart contract that enables users to **create and participate in votes** on the blockchain.  
Every vote is securely recorded on-chain, ensuring **full transparency** and **no centralized control**.  
Only the contract owner can create proposals, while anyone can vote once per proposal — making it perfect for DAOs, clubs, and small communities.

---

## ⚡ What It Does

- The **owner** (deployer) can create new proposals.  
- **Users** can vote once per proposal using their blockchain wallet.  
- **Votes are stored immutably** on the Celo blockchain.  
- Anyone can **view the proposal details and vote counts** anytime.

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ Simple and gas-efficient design  
✅ Transparent voting — visible to everyone  
✅ One vote per address per proposal  
✅ Owner-only proposal creation  
✅ Beginner-friendly Solidity structure  
✅ Easy to deploy and test using Remix + Celo Extension Wallet  

---

## 🔗 Deployed Smart Contract

**Network:** Celo Sepolia Testnet  
**Contract Address:** [0x2D2439a8B581d134Aebe8b0BAC060724D8785e59](https://celo-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0x2D2439a8B581d134Aebe8b0BAC060724D8785e59)

---

## 💻 Smart Contract Code

```solidity
//paste your code
````

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Celo Extension Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celo-extension-wallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfeljfhgjdgccfghlkh)
* Test CELO tokens from [Celo Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet)

---

### 2️⃣ Steps to Deploy

1. Open Remix IDE and create a new file named `VoteChori.sol`.
2. Paste the contract code inside (replace `//paste your code`).
3. Compile the contract with Solidity version `^0.8.20`.
4. Deploy it using “Injected Provider - MetaMask” and select **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.
5. Copy your deployed contract address and verify it on [Celo Blockscout](https://celo-sepolia.blockscout.com).

---

## 🧠 Learnings

This project helps beginners understand:

* How to **structure a Solidity contract**
* How to use **mappings, structs, and modifiers**
* How to **emit and listen to blockchain events**
* How to **deploy and interact** with contracts on testnets

## 📜 License

This project is licensed under the **MIT License**.
You’re free to use, modify, and share it for learning or building your own decentralized apps.

---

## ❤️ Acknowledgments

Built with 💛 on **Celo**
Empowering developers to make voting fair, open, and transparent on-chain.
